Major components of WebRTC include several JavaScript APIs:

getUserMedia acquires the audio and video media (e.g., by accessing a device's camera and microphone).[20]
RTCPeerConnection enables audio and video communication between peers. It performs signal processing, codec handling, peer-to-peer communication, security, and bandwidth management.[21]
RTCDataChannel allows bidirectional communication of arbitrary data between peers. It uses the same API as WebSockets and has very low latency
